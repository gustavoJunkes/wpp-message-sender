# wpp-message-sender

I made this project to play around with WhatsApp integration using the venom library.

It consists in a API and WhatsApp bot that can:
- Send WhatsApp messages via API endpoint.
- Translate WhatsApp messages.
    - Translate WhatsApp messages sent in PT-BR to EN-US.
    - Translate WhatsApp messages sent in EN-US to PT-BR.
